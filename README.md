## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Open the Colab link above  
2. Run all cells sequentially (`Runtime â†’ Run All`)  
3. All plots, metrics, and tables will be generated automatically  

---

## âœ… Requirements
The code uses standard Python libraries:  
- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  

All are available by default in Google Colab.
